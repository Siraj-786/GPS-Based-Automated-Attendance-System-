# GPS-Based Automated Attendance System  

## Overview  
This project is a mobile application designed for faculty members to manage attendance efficiently using GPS geofencing, facial recognition, and deep learning techniques. It ensures secure, accurate, and convenient attendance tracking by automating the process when faculty members enter or leave the campus.

## Features  
- **Geofencing**: Determines faculty presence within the campus area using GPS.  
- **Facial Recognition**: Employs the FaceNet model for robust and efficient facial verification.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Logs session IDs, GPS coordinates, and timestamps for accurate attendance records.  
- **Enhanced Security**: Verifies faculty identity with a unique ID and location-based confirmation.

## Development Progress  
1. Unique ID verification (one-time setup).  
2. Location verification using GPS.  
3. Facial verification using the FaceNet model.  
4. Logging session data:  
   - Session ID  
   - GPS coordinates  
   - Timestamp
